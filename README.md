## üìà ROC Curve Analysis  
![dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Zalando-Fashion-Clothing-Classification/blob/main/Images/Zalando_ROC.png?raw=true)

The ROC curves for DenseNet121 (left panel) demonstrate strong class separability, particularly for the 'shirt' and 'longsleeve' classes, which nearly hug the top-left corner ‚Äî indicating excellent true positive rates with low false positives. The 'hoodies_female' and 'sweatshirt_female' classes perform slightly lower but still show decent AUC behavior. The curves suggest that DenseNet121 is a well-calibrated model overall, achieving a good balance between sensitivity and specificity for most classes. The tight grouping near the top indicates robustness in multi-class discrimination.

The MobileNetV2 ROC curves (middle panel) show slightly weaker performance compared to DenseNet121. The 'shirt' and 'longsleeve' classes again achieve high AUCs, reflecting consistent model strength in recognizing these categories. However, the 'sweatshirt_female' and 'hoodies' curves drop more steeply, showing reduced ability to distinguish these classes from others. This suggests MobileNetV2 struggles more with complex or visually similar clothing categories ‚Äî likely due to its lightweight architecture, which limits its depth of feature extraction compared to deeper networks.

The ResNet101V2 ROC curves (right panel) are competitive and overall slightly stronger than MobileNetV2, though not as tight as DenseNet121. The 'shirt', 'longsleeve', and 'sweatshirt_female' classes display high AUC values, indicating effective detection. While there is still a modest drop for 'hoodies' and 'hoodies_female', the curves remain relatively steep with limited false positives. ResNet101V2 shows a balanced and generalized classification capacity across multiple categories, thanks to its deeper architecture and rich feature representation.


## üìâ Confusion Matrix  
![Dashboard](https://github.com/ShaikhBorhanUddin/Zalando-Fashion-Clothing-Classification/blob/main/Images/Zalando_CM.png?raw=true)

The DenseNet121 model shows strong performance, particularly for the 'shirt' class, with 473 correct predictions and minimal confusion. The 'longsleeve' class is also fairly well classified with 153 correct predictions and limited spillover into other categories. However, the 'sweatshirt' and 'sweatshirt_female' classes show considerable misclassification ‚Äî especially 'sweatshirt', which is often confused with 'hoodies' and 'longsleeve', indicating feature overlap. Notably, many 'sweatshirt_female' instances are being classified as 'hoodies_female', likely due to visual similarities in female upper-body garments.

MobileNetV2 struggles more with class separability compared to DenseNet121. The 'shirt' class again performs well (477 correct), but misclassifications increase across other categories. For instance, 'hoodies' has 24 misclassified as 'hoodies_female', and 'sweatshirt_female' is highly confused with 'hoodies_female' (143 predictions). The 'longsleeve' class suffers from significant ambiguity, with predictions spreading across 'shirt', 'sweatshirt', and even 'hoodies'. This implies that MobileNetV2 has a harder time distinguishing fine-grained clothing details, likely due to a lighter architecture and reduced representational capacity.

ResNet101V2 shows balanced performance across most categories, with stronger diagonal dominance than MobileNetV2, and slightly better than DenseNet121 in some areas. The 'shirt' class is highly accurate with 470 correct predictions. However, 'sweatshirt_female' still faces confusion, notably with 'hoodies_female' (107 misclassifications), and 'sweatshirt' often gets misclassified as 'longsleeve' and 'shirt'. ResNet101V2 does a better job distinguishing between 'hoodies' and 'sweatshirt', likely due to deeper feature extraction layers, but subtle gender-based visual differences (like 'female' labels) remain a consistent challenge across all models.
